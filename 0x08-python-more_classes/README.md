# 0x08. Python - More Classes

## Description

This directory is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming series. In these tasks, we delve deeper into the concepts of classes in Python, focusing on more advanced features and use cases. The primary objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of Python's class mechanics, including properties, methods, and special functions.

## Learning Objectives

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is OOP (“Object-Oriented Programming”)
- “first-class everything”
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
- What is `self`
- What is a method
- What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to object and classes
- What is and what does contain `__dict__` of a class and of an instance of a class
- How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the `getattr` function

## Requirements
