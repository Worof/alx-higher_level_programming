# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

## Introduction
This project marks the beginning of our journey with Python programming at ALX Higher Level Programming. The focus is on getting started with Python scripting, understanding the basics of the language, and executing Python scripts on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Throughout this project, we adhere to the Python PEP 8 style guide, ensuring our code is clean and maintainable.

## Objectives
- To familiarize ourselves with Python programming language.
- Learn how to use the Python interpreter.
- Understand how to print text and variables using `print`.
- Explore Python's use of strings and different operations.
- Get a grasp of indexing and slicing in Python.
- Dive into the official Python coding style (PEP 8).

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- The code should use the Zen of Python as a guideline.

### Shell Scripts
- All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Scripts are exactly two lines long.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`.
- All files must be executable.

## Setup and Execution
To run the Python scripts, ensure you have Python 3.8.5 installed on your Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine. Make the script files executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x <filename>
