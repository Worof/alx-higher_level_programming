# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Description
This project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum. It aims to introduce the basics of control flow in Python, including conditional statements, loops, and functions. Through this project, students will gain a deeper understanding of how to control the execution flow of their Python programs, enabling them to solve more complex problems.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and use the `if`, `else`, and `elif` conditional statements.
- Utilize loops (`for`, `while`) to iterate over sequences and execute code blocks multiple times.
- Learn how to define and call functions, including understanding of arguments and return values.
- Grasp the importance of indentation in Python and its role in defining the scope of loops and functions.
- Practice using the `random` module to generate pseudo-random numbers.
- Explore Python's arithmetic operators and how to use them in different scenarios.

## Requirements
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks
0. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing** - A program that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints whether the number is positive or negative.
1. **The last digit** - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and print the last digit of the number stored in `number`.
2. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game** - A script that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
3. **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off** - A script that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line, except `q` and `e` letters.
