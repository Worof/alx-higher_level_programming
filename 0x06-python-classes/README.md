# 0x06-python-classes Project

## Overview
This directory is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum. It focuses on the introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts using Python. The primary objective is to understand how to create and work with classes and objects in Python.

## Key Concepts
- Defining and using classes
- The `__init__` method and initialization of object attributes
- Data encapsulation and private attributes
- Property decorators to manage attribute access
- Object-oriented programming principles

## Files Description
- `0-square.py`: An empty class Square that defines a square.
- `1-square.py`: A class Square that defines a square by its size.
- `2-square.py`: A class Square that handles errors for the size attribute.
- `3-square.py`: A class Square with a method to calculate its area.
- `4-square.py`: A class Square with getter and setter methods for the size attribute.
- `5-square.py`: A class Square with a method to print the square.
- `6-square.py`: A class Square with a position attribute and updated print method.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and its contents.

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
- All files end with a new line.
- The first line of all files is `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code uses the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- Each module, class, and method must have appropriate documentation.

## Installation and Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the `0x06-python-classes` directory. Run the Python files using:

```bash
./file_name.py
