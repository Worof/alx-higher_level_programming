# 0x09. Python - Everything is Object

## Description

This project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming series. It explores the concept that everything in Python is an object. This project dives deep into understanding Python's object-oriented approach and how Python treats even the most basic data types and structures as objects. The tasks involve various exercises to solidify the understanding of Python's object model.

## Learning Objectives

- What is an object in Python
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
- What is mutable and immutable
- What are the built-in mutable types
- What are the built-in immutable types
- How does Python pass variables to functions
## Usage
Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming, specific to the Python programming language. These exercises are designed to be run with Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
