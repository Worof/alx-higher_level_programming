# 0x0F Python - Object Relational Mapping

This directory is part of the ALX higher level programming series, focusing on object-relational mapping (ORM) in Python. The exercises and examples within this directory are designed to provide hands-on experience with ORMs, specifically with MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy in Python.

## Description

This project includes several scripts that demonstrate the connection to a MySQL database, execution of SQL queries, and usage of ORM techniques in Python. The primary focus is to illustrate how Python can interact with databases and how ORMs facilitate this interaction.

## Files in This Directory

- `0-select_states.py`: A script that lists all states from the `hbtn_0e_0_usa` database.
- Additional scripts: Description of other files.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Python 3.8.5
- MySQLdb version 2.0.x
- SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
